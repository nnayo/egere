TRoll égère mini-rocket

Here are the code, the mechanical drawings and the electronic design of the mini-rocket named égère.

The code relies on other libraries:
 - nanoK
 - scalp

It is built using scons and avr-gcc suite.

The mechanical drawings are done with librecad and/or freecad.

Kicad is used for the electronics.

This projet is part of the activities of the amateur rocket TRoll association: http://clubtroll.no-ip.org (slow connection)
